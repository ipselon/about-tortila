        "title": "Upcoming Features",
        "text": "Upcoming Features for TileDocs As TileDocs continues to evolve, several developments are on the horizon. These updates aim to enhance collaboration, expand storage options, and introduce new features to make documentation even more dynamic and versatile. By focusing on these developments, TileDocs aims to bridge the gap between simplicity and advanced functionality, offering a more robust solution for documentation needs while maintaining its user-friendly approach. GitHub Integration for Collaboration and Storage A key upcoming feature is the integration with GitHub's API. This development will bring two significant benefits: Cloud-Based Storage : Users will be able to store their TileDocs projects on GitHub, allowing access from multiple devices and browsers. This solves the current limitation of browser-specific storage. Collaborative Workflow : Teams will be able to work together on documentation projects, leveraging GitHub's version control and collaboration features. Continuous Integration with GitHub In addition to storage, TileDocs will soon offer the ability to push exported HTML websites directly to GitHub repositories. This feature will enable: Automatic deployment of documentation updates Easy integration with existing CI/CD pipelines Expanding the Component Library Parallel to these integrations, TileDocs is set to introduce a range of new components to enhance document structure and presentation: Custom Frames : For embedding external content Embeds : To seamlessly incorporate various media types Galleries:  For creating image collections or portfolios Tabs : To organize content in a more compact, navigable format Columns : For flexible page layouts Feedback and Suggestions Have you been using TileDocs and want to share your experience?

        "title": "How to Export and Integrate Your Documentation",
        "text": "How to Export and Integrate Your Documentation TileDocs allows you to easily export your documentation as a static website and integrate it with your main product website. This guide will walk you through the process. Exporting Your Documentation Open the \" Export \" menu in TileDocs. Click on the \" Export to HTML \" option. Enter the base URL for your documentation. This should include the protocol ( http://  or  https:// ) and your domain name. If your documentation will be in a subdirectory, include that too. Confirm the export. TileDocs will generate all necessary files and create a zip file to download. Deploying Your Documentation For standalone deployment Unzip the downloaded file. Upload all contents to your web hosting service or HTTP server. Integrating with Your Product Website To integrate the documentation with your existing website Unzip the downloaded file. Determine where to copy the files If your base URL includes a subdirectory, copy the entire structure to that subdirectory in your website's public directory. If not, copy the contents to the root of your website's public directory. Important:  If copying to the root, do not overwrite your main website's index.html file with the one from the documentation. Linking to Documentation Pages When creating links to your documentation pages, use the directory-style format: HTML <!-- In the case of a direct link to the page --> \n < a  href = \"documentation/folder-1/page-1/\" >Page 1</ a > \n <!-- In the case of a link to the workspace --> \n < a  href = \"documentation/\" >Documentation</ a > This works because each page in the exported structure has its   index.html  file. Handling Service Files sitemap.xml : This file contains links to all your documentation pages. You can include it in your main website's sitemap index file. documents_[timestamp].txt  and  srcidx_[timestamp].txt : Copy these files to the same location as the rest of your documentation files. They're necessary for the search functionality."
